```
Why: Remove account if you don't want to keep free tier

Steps:
1. Go to: https://account.mapbox.com

## What Happens After Closure

### ✅ Still Available
- **Git Repository**: Code remains accessible forever
- **GitHub**: Free public repositories never deleted
- **Documentation**: All restoration guides preserved
- **Your Knowledge**: You know how to rebuild everything

### ❌ Lost Forever
- **User Data**: All profiles, events, matches, friendships
- **App URL**: Current deployment URL becomes inaccessible
- **Database**: All tables and data permanently deleted
- **Storage**: User avatars and uploaded files deleted
- **Push Subscriptions**: All existing push notification subscriptions lost

### 💰 No More Costs
- **Supabase**: No potential overage charges
- **Vercel**: No bandwidth or build usage
- **All Services**: Clean slate with no ongoing commitments

---

## Before You Close: Final Backup (Optional)

### Export User Data (if you want to preserve it)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor before deletion
-- Export profiles
SELECT * FROM profiles;

-- Export events
SELECT * FROM free4_events;

-- Export matches
SELECT * FROM matches;

-- Export friendships
SELECT * FROM friendships;

-- Save results as CSV files if you want the data later
```

### Download Storage Files (if needed)
```
1. Go to Supabase Storage > avatars bucket
2. Download any files you want to preserve
3. Save to local folder for future restoration
```

---

## Restoration Timeline

### When You Want to Restore Later
1. **Time Needed**: 2-3 hours for complete setup
2. **Cost**: $0 (all free tiers)
3. **Data**: Starts fresh (no old user data)
4. **Process**: Follow `CLEAN_SLATE_RESTORATION.md`

### What You'll Need
- [ ] GitHub account (to access code)
- [ ] Email address (for new service signups)
- [ ] 2-3 hours of time
- [ ] Internet connection
- [ ] Node.js installed

---

## Confidence Check

### ✅ Safe to Close When
- [ ] You understand all user data will be lost
- [ ] You're comfortable recreating everything from scratch
- [ ] Git repository is accessible and contains all code
- [ ] You have the restoration documentation
- [ ] You don't need the current deployment URL
- [ ] No users are actively using the app

### ⚠️ Consider Keeping If
- [ ] You might want to show the app to someone soon
- [ ] You have real users with data they care about
- [ ] You want to maintain the current URL/domain
- [ ] You're unsure about rebuilding later
- [ ] The free tiers don't bother you

---

## Alternative: Pause Instead of Delete

### Keep Accounts, Remove Apps
```
Supabase:
- Go to Settings > General > Pause Project
- Reactivate anytime without data loss

Vercel:
- Keep project but don't deploy
- Domain becomes inactive but easily reactivated

Result: No ongoing costs, but easier to restore with data intact
```

---

## Post-Closure Actions

### Immediately After Closure
- [ ] Verify Git repository still accessible
- [ ] Test git clone on clean machine (optional)
- [ ] Store `CLEAN_SLATE_RESTORATION.md` in safe location
- [ ] Update any documentation with closure date

### Future Reference
- [ ] Bookmark restoration guide location
- [ ] Remember: GitHub.com/Jammit5/free4-app (or your fork)
- [ ] Keep list of service websites for account creation
- [ ] Remember this was a fully working, deployable app

---

**Final Note**: Closure is irreversible for data, but the app can be rebuilt exactly as it was using the clean slate restoration guide. The code and documentation ensure nothing is truly "lost" except user data.
